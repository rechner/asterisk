QR Code Generator for GS Wave SIP Client

This is a massively, totally, HORRIBLY, insecure way of generating QR codes
for the new Grandstream 'GS Wave' Sip client, with the information in your
FreePBX machine.

Unsupported. Unadvised. But it works!  You'll have to change the code to
actually do anything sensible with it, but feel free to tidy it up and
send me a pull request.
